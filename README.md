## Overview

This project is based on Music Store dataset which has 11 different csv files such as Employee,invoice,customer,track,invoive_line,sales_per_country.I made this Project on PostgreSQL by importing Music_Store_Database.Using SQL,I performed data analysis by joining multiple tables,using subqueries,group by,order by,limit,where clause,aggregate functions,and filtering to find useful business insights such as Senior most employee,best customers,top 10 rock bands,Top Genres.

## Objective

The main objective of this Project is to analyze the music Store database and extract meaningful information using SQL.It involves:

* Understanding relationships between tables.
* Writing Complex queries using JOINs and sybqueries.
* Performing aggregation and filtering to derive insights.

 ## Business problem and Solutions

 
 

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand how databases work and how to use SQL for real-world analysis.By querying multiple related tables,I was able to find key patterns and insights.
